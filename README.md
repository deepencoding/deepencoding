  Engineer.
  I learned programming initially because it was popping but I have found a sorts of power and comfort in programming, something I can use to explore my creativity. Originally, I used to think that softwares were analytical and I had to learn something like art (I am absolutely horrible at art) but I realized basically everything revolutionary/major in software came from the mind of a person just thinking creatively and differently, pretty much it. Also, I can build fun things!
