🎖️ I'm Deepanshu, -- a self-hosted, garbage-collected, hot-reloading full-stack engineer operating at **near** real-time.

I build Enterprise clones from scratch because “what if I'm better?”, rewrite interpreters in Rust just to flex on Java (Sorry, not sorry), and spin up FFmpeg-powered video pipelines faster than your CI can finish a lint pass (Like why is it so slow). My backends don’t crash, they autoscale **out of shame**.

I don't "use" Firestore and Cloud Run, I orchestrate them like a distributed symphony with Dockerized instruments and tRPC conducting the frontend. My SvelteKit portfolio? Pre-rendered perfection with pixel-perfect SEO and Markdown-it plugins tuned tighter than your async codebase. And don't ask me what any of this means.

I once replaced an entire ML data pipeline with a 200-line GStreamer shell script and a C++ face extractor running at 90 FPS, because Python had the audacity to be “interpreted”.

Memory? Saved. Cold? Start. Latency? Packet-sniffed and shamed into submission.

In my spare time, I optimize microseconds, dockerize universes (Images get pretty big ngl), and pretend to sleep. I occasionally document this chaos on my <a href="https://deepencoding.hashnode.dev/" target="_blank">Hashnode blog</a>, where I pretend to explain what I’m doing instead of just reinventing infrastructure for fun.

Welcome to the repo zone. Expect code, caffeine (I don't actually drink coffee), and the occasional existential reflection encoded in Javascript. Ctrl+F for brilliance. Or bugs I haven’t rage-fixed yet.

<summary><h3>👨‍💻 Deepencoding's Journey</h3></summary>
I began coding in school, because who wouldn’t choose writing Python scripts over social interaction? While most kids were learning how to format Word documents, I was busy writing recursive functions and pretending <code>import this</code> was a personality trait.

College hit, and I thought, “Wow, C and C++! Finally, a language that lets me manage memory manually and leak it proudly.” By second year, I got into web dev, not because I love HTML, but because I **deeply** enjoy debugging CSS issues that only appear in Safari at 2am.

At some point, I made the questionable decision to try Competitive Programming, because nothing screams "fun" like spending your weekends figuring out why your O(n log n) solution TLEs on test case #143.

Now, I’ve graduated college, but let’s be real, titles don’t matter when you’ve already built more backend infrastructure than most MVPs in production. My GitHub is a shrine to unfinished side projects, optimized Dockerfiles, and the occasional "refactor everything at once" commit that will either win awards or crash CI.

I’m aiming for a software engineering job (Lowkey hire me), mostly so I can argue about REST vs GraphQL in a professional setting. My dream? To make something so technically sound that someone forks it just to understand what went wrong in their own life.

Keep watching, I’m not chasing greatness. I’m **unit testing** it.
